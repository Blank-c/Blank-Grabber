## Frequently Asked Questions

**1) It says file is corrupt, is it really?**
- *It is a message to make the victim think that the file is really corrupt. It will actually work!*

**2) Why is there a pyinstaller library given when we can install one ourself?**
- *This pyinstaller library has compiled bootloader so it will not raise suspicions of antiviruses.*

**3) What should be the approximate file size after compiling?**
- *The approximate file size would be around 9.5 MB. Make sure you are using virtual env which otherwise the file may  become too large.*

**4) How can I change the icon?**
- *You can replace the "icon.ico" file in the "Data" folder with your icon but name and format (.ico) must be the same.*

**5) Can my webhook get leaked?**
- *If the "virus hunter" is not familiar with Blank Grabber, there is a very less chance that your webhook is going to be found.*

**6) How can I support the development?**
- *You can star the repository and make YouTube videos about this grabber (you must include the link to the [original repository](https://github.com/Blank-c/Blank-Grabber)). But you are not allowed to name this grabber as your own creation.*
