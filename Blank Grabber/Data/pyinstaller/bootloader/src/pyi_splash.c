/**
 * Splash Screen Feature
 *
 * A splash screen is a graphical window in which a program-defined screen
 * is displayed. It is normally used to give the user visual feedback,
 * indicating that the program has been started.
 *
 * In this file the splash screen feature as of discussed in pyinstaller#4354 is
 * implemented. To show a splash screen the library tk is used. Tk is accessed by
 * and distributed with tcl inside the python standard library (as of python 3.8
 * with tcl/tk 8.6). Python uses Tcl/Tk in the module tkinter. Tkinter is a wrapper
 * between python and tcl, so using tkinter will use Tcl/Tk. Because tkinter is
 * distributed with any common python installation and it is cross-platform,
 * it is also used for this splash screen.
 *
 * PyInstaller will bundle (if splash screen is enabled) all necessary resources of
 * tcl/tk and append them onto the executable. This results in a slightly bigger
 * application distribution if a splash screen is used, but it is assumed to be negligible.
 *
 * Tcl is a simple high-level programming language like python. It is often embedded into
 * C application for prototyping. Together with Tk (called Tcl/Tk) it is a very powerful
 * tool to build graphical user interfaces and is often used to give C applications
 * a GUI, since it is easy to embed.
 *
 * For this implementation of a tcl/tk wrapper this module loads, if splash screen
 * resources are appended to the application, the shared libraries of tcl/tk and
 * initializes a minimal tcl/tk environment to run the splash screen from.
 *
 * Only threaded tcl is in this implementation supported, meaning tcl had to be compiled
 * with the --enable-threads flag enabled, which is it by default on Windows and MacOS.
 * Many Linux distributions also come with a threaded tcl installation, although it is not
 * guaranteed. PyInstaller will check at build time if tcl is threaded.
