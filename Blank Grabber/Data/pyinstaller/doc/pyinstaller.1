\.SH SYNOPSIS
.sp
\fBpyinstaller\fP <options> SCRIPT...
.sp
\fBpyinstaller\fP <options> SPECFILE
.SH DESCRIPTION
.sp
PyInstaller is a program that freezes (packages) Python programs into
stand\-alone executables, under Windows, GNU/Linux, macOS,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris and AIX.
Its main advantages over similar tools are that PyInstaller works with
Python 3.7\-3.10, it builds smaller executables thanks to transparent
compression, it is fully multi\-platform, and use the OS support to load the
dynamic libraries, thus ensuring full compatibility.
.sp
You may either pass one or more file\-names of Python scripts or a single
\fI\&.spec\fP\-file\-name. In the first case, \fBpyinstaller\fP will generate a
\fI\&.spec\fP\-file (as \fBpyi\-makespec\fP would do) and immediately process it.
.sp
If you pass a \fI\&.spec\fP\-file, this will be processed and most options given on
the command\-line will have no effect.
Please see the PyInstaller Manual for more information.

.SS How To Generate
.sp
\-d {all,imports,bootloader,noarchive}, \-\-debug {all,imports,bootloader,noarchive}
.INDENT 0.0
.INDENT 3.5
Provide assistance with debugging a frozen application. This argument may
be provided multiple times to select several of the following options.  \-
all: All three of the following options.  \- imports: specify the \-v option
to the underlying   Python interpreter, causing it to print a message
each time a module is initialized, showing the   place (filename or
built\-in module) from which it   is loaded. See
\fI\%https://docs.python.org/3/using/cmdline.html#id4\fP\&.  \- bootloader: tell the
bootloader to issue progress   messages while initializing and starting the
bundled app. Used to diagnose problems with   missing imports.  \-
noarchive: instead of storing all frozen Python   source files as an
archive inside the resulting   executable, store them as files in the
resulting   output directory.
.UNINDENT
.UNINDENT
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-python\-option \ PYTHON_OPTION
Specify a command\-line option to pass to the Python interpreter at runtime.
Currently supports "v" (equivalent to "\-\-debug imports"), "u", and "W
<warning control>".
.TP
.B \-s\fP,\fB  \-\-strip
Apply a symbol\-table strip to the executable and shared libs (not
recommended for Windows)
.TP
.B \-\-noupx
Do not use UPX even if it is available (works differently between Windows
and *nix)
.TP
.BI \-\-upx\-exclude \ FILE
Prevent a binary from being compressed when using upx. This is typically
used if upx corrupts certain binaries during compression. FILE is the
filename of the binary without path. This option can be used multiple
times.
.UNINDENT
.SS Windows And Mac Os X Specific Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-c\fP,\fB  \-\-console\fP,\fB  \-\-nowindowed
Open a console window for standard i/o (default). On Windows this option
has no effect if the first script is a \(aq.pyw\(aq file.
.TP
.B \-w\fP,\fB  \-\-windowed\fP,\fB  \-\-noconsole
Windows and Mac OS X: do not provide a console window for standard i/o. On
Mac OS this also triggers building a Mac OS .app bundle. On Windows this
option is automatically set if the first script is a \(aq.pyw\(aq file. This
option is ignored on *NIX systems.
.TP
.BI \-i \ <FILE.ico or FILE.exe,ID or FILE.icns or Image or "NONE">\fR,\fB \ \-\-icon \ <FILE.ico or FILE.exe,ID or FILE.icns or Image or "NONE">
FILE.ico: apply the icon to a Windows executable. FILE.exe,ID: extract the
icon with ID from an exe. FILE.icns: apply the icon to the .app bundle on
Mac OS. If an image file is entered that isn\(aqt in the platform format (ico
on Windows, icns on Mac), PyInstaller tries to use Pillow to translate the
icon into the correct format (if Pillow is installed). Use "NONE" to not
apply any icon, thereby making the OS show some default (default: apply
PyInstaller\(aqs icon)
.TP
.B \-\-disable\-windowed\-traceback
Disable traceback dump of unhandled exception in windowed (noconsole) mode
(Windows and macOS only), and instead display a message that this feature
is disabled.
.UNINDENT
.SS Windows Specific Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-version\-file \ FILE
Add a version resource from FILE to the exe.
.TP
.BI \-m \ <FILE or XML>\fR,\fB \ \-\-manifest \ <FILE or XML>
Add manifest FILE or XML to the exe.
.TP
.B \-\-no\-embed\-manifest
Generate an external .exe.manifest file instead of embedding the manifest
into the exe. Applicable only to onedir mode; in onefile mode, the manifest
is always embedded, regardless of this option.
.TP
.BI \-r \ RESOURCE\fR,\fB \ \-\-resource \ RESOURCE
Add or update a resource to a Windows executable. The RESOURCE is one to
four items, FILE[,TYPE[,NAME[,LANGUAGE]]]. FILE can be a data file or an
exe/dll. For data files, at least TYPE and NAME must be specified. LANGUAGE
defaults to 0 or may be specified as wildcard * to update all resources of
the given TYPE and NAME. For exe/dll files, all resources from FILE will be
added/updated to the final executable if TYPE, NAME and LANGUAGE are
omitted or specified as wildcard *. This option can be used multiple
times.
.TP
.B \-\-uac\-admin
Using this option creates a Manifest that will request elevation upon
application start.
.TP
.B \-\-uac\-uiaccess
Using this option allows an elevated application to work with Remote
Desktop.
.UNINDENT
.SS Windows Side\-By\-Side Assembly Searching Options (Advanced)
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-win\-private\-assemblies
Any Shared Assemblies bundled into the application will be changed into
Private Assemblies. This means the exact versions of these assemblies will
always be used, and any newer versions installed on user machines at the
system level will be ignored.
.TP
.B \-\-win\-no\-prefer\-redirects
While searching for Shared or Private Assemblies to bundle into the
application, PyInstaller will prefer not to follow policies that redirect
to newer versions, and will try to bundle the exact versions of the
assembly.
.UNINDENT
.SS Mac Os Specific Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B \-\-argv\-emulation
Enable argv emulation for macOS app bundles. If enabled, the initial open
document/URL event is processed by the bootloader and the passed file paths
or URLs are appended to sys.argv.
.TP
.BI \-\-osx\-bundle\-identifier \ BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER
Mac OS .app bundle identifier is used as the default unique program name
for code signing purposes. The usual form is a hierarchical name in reverse
DNS notation. For example: com.mycompany.department.appname (default: first
script\(aqs basename)
.TP
.BI \-\-target\-architecture \ ARCH\fR,\fB \ \-\-target\-arch \ ARCH
Target architecture (macOS only; valid values: x86_64, arm64, universal2).
Enables switching between universal2 and single\-arch version of frozen
application (provided python installation supports the target
architecture). If not target architecture is not specified, the current
running architecture is targeted.
.TP
.BI \-\-codesign\-identity \ IDENTITY
Code signing identity (macOS only). Use the provided identity to sign
collected binaries and generated executable. If signing identity is not
provided, ad\-hoc signing is performed instead.
.TP
.BI \-\-osx\-entitlements\-file \ FILENAME
Entitlements file to use when code\-signing the collected binaries (macOS
only).
.UNINDENT
.SS Rarely Used Special Options
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.BI \-\-runtime\-tmpdir \ PATH
Where to extract libraries and support files in \fIonefile\fP\-mode. If this
option is given, the bootloader will ignore any temp\-folder location
defined by the run\-time OS. The \fB_MEIxxxxxx\fP\-folder will be created here.
Please use this option only if you know what you are doing.
.TP
.B \-\-bootloader\-ignore\-signals
Tell the bootloader to ignore signals rather than forwarding them to the
child process. Useful in situations where for example a supervisor process
signals both the bootloader and the child (e.g., via a process group) to
avoid signalling the child twice.
.UNINDENT
.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.INDENT 0.0
.TP
.B PYINSTALLER_CONFIG_DIR
This changes the directory where PyInstaller caches some files.
The default location for this is operating system dependent,
but is typically a subdirectory of the home directory.
