5.1 (2022-05-17)
-----------------

Bugfix
~~~~~~

* (Windows) Fix the regression causing the (relative) spec path ending up
  prepended to relative icon path twice, resulting in icon not being found.
  (:issue:`6788`)
* Prevent collection of an entire Python site when using
  :func:`~PyInstaller.utils.hooks.collect_data_files` or
  :func:`~PyInstaller.utils.hooks.collect_dynamic_libs` for single-file modules
  (:issue:`6789`)
* Prevent the hook utility functions, such as
  :func:`~PyInstaller.utils.hooks.collect_submodules`,
  :func:`~PyInstaller.utils.hooks.collect_data_files`, and
  :func:`~PyInstaller.utils.hooks.collect_dynamic_libs`, from failing to
  identify a package when its PEP451-compliant loader does not implement
  the optional ``is_package`` method. (:issue:`6790`)
* The :func:`~PyInstaller.utils.hooks.get_package_paths` function now
  supports PEP420 namespace packages - although for backwards-compatibility
  reasons, it returns only the first path when multiple paths are
  present. (:issue:`6790`)
* The hook utility functions
  :func:`~PyInstaller.utils.hooks.collect_submodules`,
  :func:`~PyInstaller.utils.hooks.collect_data_files`, and
  :func:`~PyInstaller.utils.hooks.collect_dynamic_libs`) now support
  collection from PEP420 namespace packages. (:issue:`6790`)
* The user-provided spec file path and paths provided via :option:`--workpath`
  and :option:`--distpath` are now resolved to absolute full paths before being
  passed to PyInstaller's internals. (:issue:`6788`)


Hooks
~~~~~

* Exclude ``doctest`` in the ``pickle`` hook. Update ``PySide2``, ``PySide6``,
  ``PyQt5``, and ``PyQt6`` hooks with hidden imports that were previously
  pulled in by ``doctest`` (that was in turn pulled in by ``pickle``).
  (:issue:`6797`)


Bootloader
~~~~~~~~~~

* (Windows) Update the bundled ``zlib`` sources to v1.2.12. (:issue:`6804`)


Bootloader build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Building on Windows with MSVC no longer falls to bits if the PyInstaller repo
  is
  stored in a directory with a long path. (:issue:`6806`)


5.0.1 (2022-04-25)
------------------

Bugfix
~~~~~~

* (Linux) Have ``glib`` runtime hook prepend the frozen application's data
  dir to the ``XDG_DATA_DIRS`` environment variable instead of completely
  overwriting it. This should fix the case when ``xdg-open`` is used to
  launch a system-installed application (for example, opening an URL in a
  web browser via the ``webbrowser`` module) and no registered applications
  being found. (:issue:`3668`)
* Prevent unactionable errors raised by UPX from terminating the build.
  (:issue:`6757`)
* Restore the pre PyInstaller 5.0 behavior of resolving relative paths to icons
  as
  relative to the spec file rather than the current working directory.
  (:issue:`6759`)
* (Windows) Update system DLL inclusion list to allow collection of DLLs from
  Visual Studio 2012 (VC11) runtime and Visual Studio 2013 (VC12) runtime,
  as well as the latest version of Visual Studio 2015/2017/2019/2022 (VC14)
  runtime (14.3). (:issue:`6778`)


Hooks
~~~~~

* Refactor ``QtWebEngine`` hooks to support both pure Widget-based and
  pure QML/Quick-based applications. (:issue:`6753`)
* Update PySide6 and PyQt6 hooks for compatibility with Qt 6.3. ``QtWebEngine``
  on Windows and Linux does not provide the ``qt.conf`` file for the helper
  executable anymore, so we generate our own version of the file in order for
  ``QtWebengine`` -based frozen applications to work. (:issue:`6769`)


5.0 (2022-04-15)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* (macOS) App bundles built in ``onedir`` mode can now opt-in for :ref:`argv
  emulation <macos event forwarding and argv emulation>` so that file paths
  passed from the UI (`Open with...`) are reflected in :data:`sys.argv`.
  (:issue:`5908`)
* (macOS) App bundles built in ``onedir`` mode can now opt-in for :ref:`argv
  emulation <macos event forwarding and argv emulation>` so that file paths
  received in initial drag & drop event are reflected in :data:`sys.argv`.
  (:issue:`5436`)
* (macOS) The :ref:`argv emulation <macos event forwarding and argv emulation>`
  functionality is now available as an optional feature for app bundles
  built in either ``onefile`` or ``onedir`` mode. (:issue:`6089`)
* (Windows) Embed the manifest into generated ``onedir`` executables by
  default, in order to avoid potential issues when user renames the executable
  (e.g., the manifest not being found anymore due to activation context
  caching when user renames the executable and attempts to run it before
  also renaming the manifest file). The old behavior of generating the
  external manifest file in ``onedir`` mode can be re-enabled using the
  :option:`--no-embed-manifest` command-line switch, or via the
  ``embed_manifest=False`` argument to ``EXE()`` in the .spec file.
  (:issue:`6223`)
* (Wine) Prevent collection of Wine built-in DLLs (in either PE-converted or
  fake/placeholder form) when building a Windows frozen application under
  Wine. Display a warning for each excluded Wine built-in DLL. (:issue:`6149`)
* Add a :mod:`PyInstaller.isolated` submodule as a safer replacement to
  :func:`PyInstaller.utils.hooks.exec_statement`. (:issue:`6052`)
* Improve matching of UPX exclude patterns to include OS-default case
  sensitivity,
  the wildcard operator (``*``), and support for parent directories in the
  pattern.
  Enables use of patterns like ``"Qt*.dll"`` and ``"PySide2*.pyd"``.
  (:issue:`6161`)
* Make the error handing of :func:`~PyInstaller.utils.hooks.collect_submodules`
  configurable. (:issue:`6052`)


Bugfix
~~~~~~

* (macOS) Fix potential loss of Apple Events during ``onefile`` app bundle
  start-up, when the child process is not yet ready to receive events
  forwarded by the parent process. (:issue:`6089`)
* (Windows) Remove the attempt to load the manifest of a ``onefile``
  frozen executable via the activation context, which fails with *An
  attempt to set the process default activation context failed because
  the process default activation context was already set.* message that
  can be observed in debug builds. This approach has been invalid ever
  since :issue:`3746` implemented direct manifest embedding into the
  ``onefile`` executable. (:issue:`6203`)
* Fix an import leak when
  :func:`PyInstaller.utils.hooks.get_module_file_attribute`
  is called with a sub-module or a sub-package name. (:issue:`6169`)
* Fix an import leak when :func:`PyInstaller.utils.hooks.is_package`
  is called with a sub-module or a sub-package name. (:issue:`6169`)
* Fix import errors when calling ``get_gi_libdir()`` during packaging of GTK
  apps.
  Enable CI tests of GTK by adding PyGObject dependencies for the Ubuntu
  builds. (:issue:`6300`)
* Issue an error report if a `.spec` file will not be generated, but
  command-line options specific to that functionality are given.
  (:issue:`6660`)
* Prevent ``onefile`` cleanup from recursing into symlinked directories and
  just remove the link instead. (:issue:`6074`)


Incompatible Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* (macOS) App bundles built in ``onefile`` mode do not perform
  :ref:`argv emulation <macos event forwarding and argv emulation>` by
  default anymore. The functionality of converting initial open document/URL
  events into ``sys.argv`` entries must now be explicitly opted-in,
  via ``argv_emulation=True`` argument to ``EXE()`` in the .spec file
  or via :option:`--argv-emulation` command-line flag. (:issue:`6089`)
* (Windows) By default, manifest is now embedded into the executable in
  ``onedir`` mode. The old behavior of generating the external manifest
  file can be re-enabled using the :option:`--no-embed-manifest`
  command-line switch, or via the ``embed_manifest=False`` argument to
  ``EXE()`` in the .spec file. (:issue:`6223`)
* Issue an error report if a `.spec` file will not be generated, but
  command-line options specific to that functionality are given.
  (:issue:`6660`)
* The :func:`PyInstaller.utils.hooks.get_module_attribute` function now
  returns the actual attribute value instead of its string representation.
  The external users (e.g., 3rd party hooks) of this function must adjust
  their handling of the return value accordingly. (:issue:`6169`)
* The ``matplotlib.backends`` hook no longer collects all available
  ``matplotlib`` backends, but rather tries to auto-detect the used
  backend(s) by default. The old behavior can be re-enabled via the
  :ref:`hook configuration option <matplotlib hook options>`. (:issue:`6024`)


Hooks
~~~~~

* Rework the ``matplotlib.backends`` hook to attempt performing
  auto-detection of the used backend(s) instead of collecting all
  available backends. Implement :ref:`hook configuration option
  <matplotlib hook options>` that allows users to switch between
  this new behavior and the old behavior of collecting all backends,
  or to manually specify the backend(s) to be collected. (:issue:`6024`)


Bootloader
~~~~~~~~~~

* Change the behaviour of the ``--no-universal2`` flag so that it now assumes
  the
  target architecture of the compiler (which may be overridden via the ``CC``
  environment variable to facilitate cross compiling). (:issue:`6096`)
* Refactor Apple Events handling code and move it into a separate source file.
  (:issue:`6089`)


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add a :ref:`new section <macos event forwarding and argv emulation>`
  describing Apple Event forwarding behavior on macOS and the optional
  `argv emulation` for macOS app bundles, along with its caveats.
  (:issue:`6089`)
* Update documentation on using ``UPX``. (:issue:`6161`)


PyInstaller Core
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Drop support for Python 3.6. (:issue:`6475`)


Bootloader build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* (Windows) Enable `Control Flow Guard
  <https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secbp/control-flow-guard>`_
  for the Windows bootloader. (:issue:`6136`)


4.10 (2022-03-05)
-----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* (Wine) Prevent collection of Wine built-in DLLs (in either PE-converted or
  fake/placeholder form) when building a Windows frozen application under
  Wine. Display a warning for each excluded Wine built-in DLL. (:issue:`6622`)


Bugfix
~~~~~~

* (Linux) Remove the timeout on ``objcopy`` operations to prevent wrongful
  abortions when processing large executables on slow disks. (:issue:`6647`)
* (macOS) Limit the strict architecture validation for collected binaries to
  extension modules only. Fixes architecture validation errors when a
  ``universal2`` package has its multi-arch extension modules' arch slices
  linked against distinct single-arch thin shared libraries, as is the
  case with ``scipy`` 1.8.0 macOS ``universal2`` wheel. (:issue:`6587`)
* (macOS) Remove the 60 seconds timeout for each ``codesign`` and ``lipo``
  operation which caused build abortion when
  processing huge binaries. (:issue:`6644`)
* (Windows) Use a made up (not ``.exe``) suffix for intermediate executable
  files during the build process to prevent
  antiviruses from attempting to scan the file whilst PyInstaller is still
  working on it leading to a
  :class:`PermissionError` at build time. (:issue:`6467`)
* Fix an attempt to collect a non-existent ``.pyc`` file when the corresponding
  source ``.py`` file has ``st_mtime`` set to zero. (:issue:`6625`)


Hooks
~~~~~

* Add ``IPython`` to the list of excluded packages in the ``PIL`` hook in
  order to prevent automatic collection of ``IPython`` when it is not
  imported anywhere else. This in turn prevents whole ``matplotlib`` being
  automatically pulled in when using  ``PIL.Image``. (:issue:`6605`)


Bootloader
~~~~~~~~~~

* Fix detection of 32-bit ``arm`` platform when Thumb instruction set is
  enabled in the compiler. In this case, the ``ctx.env.DEST_CPU`` in
  ``waf`` build script is set to ``thumb`` instead of ``arm``. (:issue:`6532`)


4.9 (2022-02-03)
----------------

Bugfix
~~~~~~

* Add support for external paths when running ``pkgutil.iter_modules``.
  Add support for multiple search paths to ``pkgutil.iter_modules``.
  Correctly handle ``pkgutil.iter_modules`` with an empty list.
  (:issue:`6529`)
* Fix finding ``libpython3x.so`` when Python is installed with pyenv and the
  python executable is not linked against ``libpython3x.so``. (:issue:`6542`)
* Fix handling of symbolic links in the path matching part of the
  PyInstaller's ``pkgutil.iter_modules`` replacement/override. (:issue:`6537`)


Hooks
~~~~~

* Add hooks for ``PySide6.QtMultimedia`` and ``PyQt6.QtMultimedia``.
  (:issue:`6489`)
* Add hooks for ``QtMultimediaWidgets`` of all four supported Qt bindings
  (``PySide2``, ``PySide6``, ``PyQt5``, and ``PySide6``). (:issue:`6489`)
* Add support for ``setuptools 60.7.1`` and its vendoring  of ``jaraco.text``
  in ``pkg_resources``. Exit with an error message if ``setuptools 60.7.0``
  is encountered due to incompatibility with PyInstaller's loader logic.
  (:issue:`6564`)
* Collect the ``QtWaylandClient``-related plugins to enable Wayland support in
  the
  frozen applications using any of the four supported Qt bindings (``PySide2``,
  ``PyQt5``, ``PySide6``, and ``PyQt6``). (:issue:`6483`)
* Fix the issue with missing ``QtMultimediaWidgets`` module when using
  ``PySide2.QtMultimedia`` or ``PySide6.QtMultimedia`` in combination
  with PySide's ``true_property`` `feature
  <https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/feature-why.html#the-true-property-feature>`_.
  (:issue:`6489`)


4.8 (2022-01-06)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* (Windows) Set the executable's build time in PE header to the current
  time. A custom timestamp can be specified via the ``SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH``
  environment variable to allow reproducible builds. (:issue:`6469`)
* Add strictly unofficial support for the `Termux
  <https://f-droid.org/en/packages/com.termux/>`_ platform. (:issue:`6484`)
* Replace the dual-process ``onedir`` mode on Linux and other Unix-like OSes
  with a single-process implementation. This makes ``onedir`` mode on these
  OSes comparable to Windows and macOS, where single-process ``onedir`` mode
  has already been used for a while. (:issue:`6407`)


Bugfix
~~~~~~

* (macOS) Fix regression in generation of ``universal2`` executables that
  caused the generated executable to fail ``codesign`` strict validation.
  (:issue:`6381`)
* (Windows) Fix ``onefile`` extraction behavior when the run-time temporary
  directory is set to a drive letter. The application's temporary directory
  is now created directly on the specified drive as opposed to the current
  directory on the specified drive. (:issue:`6051`)
* (Windows) Fix compatibility issues with python 3.9.8 from python.org, arising
  from the lack of embedded manifest in the ``python.exe`` executable.
  (:issue:`6367`)
* (Windows) Fix stack overflow in `pyarmor`-protected frozen applications,
  caused
  by the executable's stack being smaller than that of the python interpreter.
  (:issue:`6459`)
* (Windows) Fix the ``python3.dll`` shared library not being found and
  collected when using Python from MS App Store. (:issue:`6390`)
* Fix a bug that prevented traceback from uncaught exception to be
  retrieved and displayed in the windowed bootloader's error reporting
  facility (uncaught exception dialog on Windows, syslog on macOS).
  (:issue:`6426`)
* Fix a crash when a onefile build attempts to overwrite an existing onedir
  build
  on macOS or Linux (:issue:`6418`)
* Fix build errors when a linux shared library (.so) file is collected as
  a binary on macOS. (:issue:`6327`)
* Fix build errors when a Windows DLL/PYD file is collected as a binary on
  a non-Windows OS. (:issue:`6327`)
* Fix handling of encodings when reading the collected .py source files
  via ``FrozenImporter.get_source()``. (:issue:`6143`)
* Fix hook loader function not finding hooks if path has whitespaces.
  (Re-apply the fix that has been inadvertedly undone during the
  codebase reformatting.) (:issue:`6080`)
* Windows: Prevent invalid handle errors when an application compiled in
  :option:`--windowed` mode uses :mod:`subprocess`
  without explicitly setting **stdin**, **stdout** and **stderr** to either
  :data:`~subprocess.PIPE` or
  :data:`~subprocess.DEVNULL`. (:issue:`6364`)


Hooks
~~~~~

* (macOS) Add support for Anaconda-installed ``PyQtWebEngine``.
  (:issue:`6373`)
* Add hooks for ``PySide6.QtWebEngineWidgets`` and
  ``PyQt6.QtWebEngineWidgets``.
  The ``QtWebEngine`` support in PyInstaller requires ``Qt6`` v6.2.2 or later,
  so if an earlier version is encountered, we exit with an error instead of
  producing a defunct build. (:issue:`6387`)
* Avoid collecting the whole ``QtQml`` module and its dependencies in cases
  when it is not necessary (i.e., the application does not use ``QtQml`` or
  ``QtQuick`` modules). The unnecessary collection was triggered due to
  extension modules being linked against the ``libQt5Qml`` or ``libQt6Qml``
  shared library, and affected pure widget-based applications (``PySide2``
  and ``PySide6`` on Linux) and widget-based applications that use
  ``QtWebEngineWidgets`` (``PySide2``, ``PySide6``, ``PyQt5``, and ``PyQt6``
  on all OSes). (:issue:`6447`)
* Update ``numpy`` hook for compatibility with version 1.22; the hook
  cannot exclude ``distutils`` and ``numpy.distutils`` anymore, as they
  are required by ``numpy.testing``, which is used by some external
  packages, such as ``scipy``. (:issue:`6474`)


Bootloader
~~~~~~~~~~

* (Windows) Set the bootloader executable's stack size to 2 MB to match the
  stack size of the python interpreter executable. (:issue:`6459`)
* Implement single-process ``onedir`` mode for Linux and Unix-like OSes as a
  replacement for previously-used two-process implementation. The new mode
  uses ``exec()`` without ``fork()`` to restart the bootloader executable
  image within the same process after setting up the environment (i.e., the
  ``LD_LIBRARY_PATH`` and other environment variables). (:issue:`6407`)
* Lock the PKG sideload mode in the bootloader unless the executable has a
  special signature embedded. (:issue:`6470`)
* When user script terminates with an uncaught exception, ensure that the
  exception data obtained via ``PyErr_Fetch`` is normalized by also calling
  ``PyErr_NormalizeException``. Otherwise, trying to format the traceback
  via ``traceback.format_exception`` fails in some circumstances, and no
  traceback can be displayed in the windowed bootloader's error report.
  (:issue:`6426`)


Bootloader build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* The bootloader can be force compiled during pip install by setting the
  environment variable ``PYINSTALLER_COMPILE_BOOTLOADER``. (:issue:`6384`)


4.7 (2021-11-10)
----------------

Bugfix
~~~~~~

* Fix a bug since v4.6 where certain Unix system directories were incorrectly
  assumed to exist and resulted in
  a :class:`FileNotFoundError`. (:issue:`6331`)


Hooks
~~~~~

* Update ``sphinx`` hook for compatibility with latest version (4.2.0).
  (:issue:`6330`)


Bootloader
~~~~~~~~~~

* (Windows) Explicitly set ``NTDDI_VERSION=0x06010000`` and
  ``_WIN32_WINNT=0x0601`` when compiling Windows bootloaders to request
  Windows 7 feature level for Windows headers. The windowed bootloader
  requires at least Windows Vista feature level, and some toolchains
  (e.g., mingw cross-compiler on linux) set too low level by default.
  (:issue:`6338`)
* (Windows) Remove the check for the unused ``windres`` utility when compiling
  with MinGW toolchain. (:issue:`6339`)
* Replace use of ``PyRun_SimpleString`` with ``PyRun_SimpleStringFlags``.
  (:issue:`6332`)


4.6 (2021-10-29)
-------------------------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Add support for Python 3.10. (:issue:`5693`)

* (Windows) Embed the manifest into generated ``onedir`` executables by
  default, in order to avoid potential issues when user renames the executable
  (e.g., the manifest not being found anymore due to activation context
  caching when user renames the executable and attempts to run it before
  also renaming the manifest file). The old behavior of generating the
  external manifest file in ``onedir`` mode can be re-enabled using the
  :option:`--no-embed-manifest` command-line switch, or via the
  ``embed_manifest=False`` argument to ``EXE()`` in the .spec file.
  (:issue:`6248`)
* (Windows) Respect :pep:`239` encoding specifiers in Window's VSVersionInfo
  files. (:issue:`6259`)
* Implement basic resource reader for accessing on-filesystem resources (data
  files)
  via ``importlib.resources`` (python >= 3.9) or ``importlib_resources``
  (python <= 3.8). (:issue:`5616`)
* Ship precompiled wheels for musl-based Linux distributions (such as Alpine or
  OpenWRT) on ``x86_64`` and ``aarch64``. (:issue:`6245`)


Bugfix
~~~~~~

* (macOS) Ensure that executable pre-processing and post-processing steps
  (target arch selection, SDK version adjustment, (re)signing) are applied in
  the stand-alone PKG mode. (:issue:`6251`)
* (macOS) Robustify the macOS assembly pipeline to work around the issues with
  the ``codesign`` utility on macOS 10.13 High Sierra. (:issue:`6167`)
* (Windows) Fix collection of ``sysconfig`` platform-specific data module when
  using MSYS2/MINGW python. (:issue:`6118`)
* (Windows) Fix displayed script name and exception message in the
  unhandled exception dialog (windowed mode) when bootloader is compiled
  using the ``MinGW-w64`` toolchain. (:issue:`6199`)
* (Windows) Fix issues in ``onedir`` frozen applications when the bootloader
  is compiled using a toolchain that forcibly embeds a default manifest
  (e.g., the ``MinGW-w64`` toolchain from ``msys2``). The issues range from
  manifest-related options (e.g., ``uac-admin``) not working to windowed frozen
  application not starting at all (with the ``The procedure entry point
  LoadIconMetric could not be located...`` error message). (:issue:`6196`)
* (Windows) Fix the declared length of strings in the optional embedded
  product version information resource structure. The declared lengths
  were twice too long, and resulted in trailing garbage characters when
  the version information was read using `ctypes` and winver API.
  (:issue:`6219`)
* (Windows) Remove the attempt to load the manifest of a ``onefile``
  frozen executable via the activation context, which fails with ``An
  attempt to set the process default activation context failed because
  the process default activation context was already set.`` message that
  can be observed in debug builds. This approach has been invalid ever
  since :issue:`3746` implemented direct manifest embedding into the
  ``onefile`` executable. (:issue:`6248`)
* (Windows) Suppress missing library warnings for ``api-ms-win-core-*`` DLLs.
  (:issue:`6201`)
* (Windows) Tolerate reading Windows VSVersionInfo files with unicode byte
  order
  marks. (:issue:`6259`)
* Fix ``sys.executable`` pointing to the external package file instead of
  the executable when in package side-load mode (``pkg_append=False``).
  (:issue:`6202`)
* Fix a runaway glob which caused ``ctypes.util.find_library("libfoo")`` to
  non-deterministically pick any library
  matching ``libfoo*`` to bundle instead of ``libfoo.so``. (:issue:`6245`)
* Fix compatibility with with MIPS and loongarch64 architectures.
  (:issue:`6306`)
* Fix the ``FrozenImporter.get_source()`` to correctly handle the packages'
  ``__init__.py`` source  files. This in turn fixes missing-source-file
  errors for packages that use ``pytorch`` JIT when the source .py files
  are collected and available (for example, ``kornia``). (:issue:`6237`)
* Fix the location of the generated stand-alone pkg file when using the
  side-load mode (``pkg_append=False``) in combination with ``onefile`` mode.
  The package file is now placed next to the executable instead of next to
  the .spec file. (:issue:`6202`)
* When generating spec files, avoid hard-coding the spec file's location as the
  ``pathex`` argument to the ``Analysis``. (:issue:`6254`)


Incompatible Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* (Windows) By default, manifest is now embedded into the executable in
  ``onedir`` mode. The old behavior of generating the external manifest
  file can be re-enabled using the :option:`--no-embed-manifest`
  command-line switch, or via the ``embed_manifest=False`` argument to
  ``EXE()`` in the .spec file. (:issue:`6248`)


Hooks
~~~~~

* (macOS) Fix compatibility with Anaconda ``PyQt5`` package. (:issue:`6181`)
* Add a hook for ``pandas.plotting`` to restore compatibility with ``pandas``
  1.3.0
  and later. (:issue:`5994`)
* Add a hook for ``QtOpenGLWidgets`` for ``PyQt6`` and ``PySide6`` to collect
  the new ``QtOpenGLWidgets`` module introduced in Qt6 (:issue:`6310`)
* Add hooks for ``QtPositioning`` and ``QtLocation`` modules of the Qt5-based
  packages (``PySide2`` and ``PyQt5``) to ensure that corresponding plugins
  are collected. (:issue:`6250`)
* Fix compatibility with ``PyQt5`` 5.9.2 from conda's  main channel.
  (:issue:`6114`)
* Prevent potential error in hooks for Qt-based packages that could be
  triggered
  by a partial ``PyQt6`` installation. (:issue:`6141`)
* Update ``QtNetwork`` hook for ``PyQt6`` and ``PySide6``  to collect the
  new ``tls`` plugins that were introduced in Qt 6.2. (:issue:`6276`)
* Update the ``gi.repository.GtkSource`` hook to accept a module-versions
  hooksconfig dict in order to allow the hook to be used with GtkSource
  versions
  greater than 3.0. (:issue:`6267`)


Bootloader
~~~~~~~~~~

* (Windows) Suppress two ``snprintf`` truncation warnings that prevented
  bootloader from building with ``winlibs MinGW-w64`` toolchain.
  (:issue:`6196`)
* Update the Linux bootloader cross compiler Dockerfile to allow using `the
  official PyPA base images
  <https://quay.io/organization/pypa/>`_ in place of the dockcross ones.
  (:issue:`6245`)


4.5.1 (2021-08-06)
------------------

Bugfix
~~~~~~

* Fix hook loader function not finding hooks if path has whitespaces.
  (:issue:`6080`)


4.5 (2021-08-01)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* (POSIX) Add ``exclude_system_libraries`` function to the Analysis class
  for .spec files,
  to exclude most or all non-Python system libraries from the bundle.
  Documented in new :ref:`POSIX Specific Options` section. (:issue:`6022`)


Bugfix
~~~~~~

* (Cygwin) Add ``_MEIPASS`` to DLL search path to fix loading of python shared
  library in onefile builds made in cygwin environment and executed outside of
  it. (:issue:`6000`)
* (Linux) Display missing library warnings for "not found" lines in ``ldd``
  output (i.e., ``libsomething.so => not found``) instead of quietly
  ignoring them. (:issue:`6015`)
* (Linux) Fix spurious missing library warning when ``libc.so`` points to
  ``ldd``. (:issue:`6015`)
* (macOS) Fix python shared library detection for non-framework python builds
  when the library  path cannot be inferred from imports of the ``python``
  executable. (:issue:`6021`)
* (macOS) Fix the crashes in ``onedir`` bundles of ``tkinter``-based
  applications
  created using Homebrew python 3.9 and Tcl/Tk 8.6.11. (:issue:`6043`)
* (macOS) When fixing executable for codesigning, update the value of
  ``vmsize`` field in the ``__LINKEDIT`` segment. (:issue:`6039`)
* Downgrade messages about missing dynamic link libraries from ERROR to
  WARNING. (:issue:`6015`)
* Fix a bytecode parsing bug which caused tuple index errors whilst scanning
  modules which use :mod:`ctypes`. (:issue:`6007`)
* Fix an error when rhtooks for ``pkgutil`` and ``pkg_resources`` are used
  together. (:issue:`6018`)
* Fix architecture detection on Apple M1 (:issue:`6029`)
* Fix crash in windowed bootloader when the traceback for unhandled exception
  cannot be retrieved. (:issue:`6070`)
* Improve handling of errors when loading hook entry-points. (:issue:`6028`)
* Suppress missing library warning for ``shiboken2`` (``PySide2``) and
  ``shiboken6`` (``PySide6``) shared library. (:issue:`6015`)


Incompatible Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* (macOS) Disable processing of Apple events for the purpose of argv emulation
  in ``onedir`` application bundles. This functionality was introduced in
  PyInstaller 4.4 by (:issue:`5920`) in response to feature requests
  (:issue:`5436`) and (:issue:`5908`), but was discovered to be breaking
  ``tkinter``-based ``onedir`` bundles made with Homebrew python 3.9 and
  Tcl/Tk 8.6.11 (:issue:`6043`). As such, until the cause is investigated
  and the issue addressed, this feature is reverted/disabled. (:issue:`6048`)


Hooks
~~~~~

* Add a hook for ``pandas.io.formats.style`` to deal with indirect import of
  ``jinja2`` and the missing template file. (:issue:`6010`)
* Simplify the ``PySide2.QWebEngineWidgets`` and ``PyQt5.QWebEngineWidgets`` by
  merging most of their code into a common helper function. (:issue:`6020`)


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Add a page describing hook configuration mechanism and the currently
  implemented options. (:issue:`6025`)


PyInstaller Core
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Isolate discovery of 3rd-party hook directories into a separate
  subprocess to avoid importing packages in the main process. (:issue:`6032`)


Bootloader build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Allow statically linking zlib on non-Windows specified via either a
  ``--static-zlib`` flag or a ``PYI_STATIC_ZLIB=1`` environment variable.
  (:issue:`6010`)


4.4 (2021-07-13)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* (macOS) Implement signing of .app bundle (ad-hoc or with actual signing
  identity, if provided). (:issue:`5581`)
* (macOS) Implement support for Apple Silicon M1 (``arm64``) platform
  and different targets for frozen applications (thin-binary ``x86_64``,
  thin-binary ``arm64``, and fat-binary ``universal2``), with build-time
  arch validation and ad-hoc resigning of all collected binaries.
  (:issue:`5581`)
* (macOS) In ``onedir`` ``windowed`` (.app bundle) mode, perform an
  interaction of Apple event processing to convert ``odoc`` and ``GURL``
  events to ``sys.argv`` before entering frozen python script. (:issue:`5920`)
* (macOS) In windowed (.app bundle) mode, always log unhandled exception
  information to ``syslog``, regardless of debug mode. (:issue:`5890`)
* (Windows) Add support for Python from Microsoft App Store. (:issue:`5816`)
* (Windows) Implement a custom dialog for displaying information about
  unhandled
  exception and its traceback when running in windowed/noconsole mode.
  (:issue:`5890`)
* Add **recursive** option to :func:`PyInstaller.utils.hooks.copy_metadata()`.
  (:issue:`5830`)
* Add ``--codesign-identity``  command-line switch to perform code-signing
  with actual signing identity instead of ad-hoc signing (macOS only).
  (:issue:`5581`)
* Add ``--osx-entitlements-file`` command-line switch that specifies optional
  entitlements file to be used during code signing of collected binaries
  (macOS only). (:issue:`5581`)
* Add ``--target-arch`` command-line switch to select target architecture
  for frozen application (macOS only). (:issue:`5581`)
* Add a splash screen that displays a background image and text:
  The splash screen can be controlled from within Python using the
  ``pyi_splash`` module.
  A splash screen can be added using the ``--splash IMAGE_FILE`` option.
  If optional text is enabled, the splash screen will show the progress of
  unpacking in
  onefile mode.
  This feature is supported only on Windows and Linux.
  A huge thanks to `@Chrisg2000 <https://github.com/Chrisg2000>`_ for
  programming this feature. (:issue:`4354`, :issue:`4887`)
* Add hooks for ``PyQt6``. (:issue:`5865`)
* Add hooks for ``PySide6``. (:issue:`5865`)
* Add option to opt-out from reporting full traceback for unhandled exceptions
  in windowed mode (Windows and macOS only), via
  ``--disable-windowed-traceback``
  PyInstaller CLI switch and the corresponding ``disable_windowed_traceback``
  boolean argument to ``EXE()`` in spec file. (:issue:`5890`)
* Allow specify which icon set, themes and locales
  to pack with Gtk applications.
  Pass a keyword arg ``hooksconfig`` to
  Analysis.

  .. code-block:: python

      a = Analysis(["my-gtk-app.py"],
                   ...,
                   hooksconfig={
                       "gi": {
                           "icons": ["Adwaita"],
                           "themes": ["Adwaita"],
                           "languages": ["en_GB", "zh_CN"]
                       }
                   },
                   ...)

  (:issue:`5853`)
* Automatically exclude Qt plugins from UPX processing. (:issue:`4178`)
* Collect distribution metadata automatically.
  This works by scanning collected Python files for uses of:

  * ``pkg_resources.get_distribution()``
  * ``pkg_resources.require()``
  * ``importlib.metadata.distribution()``
  * ``importlib.metadata.metadata()``
  * ``importlib.metadata.files()``
  * ``importlib.metadata.version()``

  In all cases, the metadata will only be collected if the distribution name is
  given as a plain string literal. Anything more complex will still require a
  hook containing :func:`PyInstaller.utils.hooks.copy_metadata`.
  (:issue:`5830`)
* Implement support for :func:`pkgutil.iter_modules`. (:issue:`1905`)
* Windows: Provide a meaningful error message if given an icon in an
  unsupported
  Image format. (:issue:`5755`)


Bugfix
~~~~~~

* (macOS) App bundles built in ``onedir`` mode now filter out ``-psnxxx``
  command-line argument from ``sys.argv``, to keep behavior consistent
  with bundles built in ``onefile`` mode. (:issue:`5920`)
* (macOS) Ensure that the macOS SDK version reported by the frozen application
  corresponds to the minimum of the SDK version used to build the bootloader
  and the SDK version used to build the Python library. Having the application
  report more recent version than Python library and other bundled libraries
  may result in macOS attempting to enable additional features that are not
  available in the Python library, which may in turn cause inconsistent
  behavior
  and UI issues with ``tkinter``. (:issue:`5839`)
* (macOS) Remove spurious ``MacOS/`` prefix from ``CFBundleExecutable``
  property
  in the generated ``Info.plist`` when building an app bundle. (:issue:`4413`,
  :issue:`5442`)
* (macOS) The drag & drop file paths passed to app bundles built in
  ``onedir`` mode are now reflected in ``sys.argv``. (:issue:`5436`)
* (macOS) The file paths passed from the UI (`Open with...`) to app bundles
  built in ``onedir`` mode are now reflected in ``sys.argv``. (:issue:`5908`)
* (macOS) Work around the ``tkinter`` UI issues due to problems with
  dark mode activation: black ``Tk`` window with macOS Intel installers
  from ``python.org``, or white text on bright background with Anaconda
  python. (:issue:`5827`)
* (Windows) Enable collection of additional VC runtime DLLs (``msvcp140.dll``,
  ``msvcp140_1.dll``, ``msvcp140_2.dll``, and ``vcruntime140_1.dll``), to
  allow frozen applications to run on Windows systems that do not have
  `Visual Studio 2015/2017/2019 Redistributable` installed. (:issue:`5770`)
* Enable retrieval of code object for ``__main__`` module via its associated
  loader (i.e., ``FrozenImporter``). (:issue:`5897`)
* Fix :func:`inspect.getmodule` failing to resolve module from stack-frame
  obtained via :func:`inspect.stack`. (:issue:`5963`)
* Fix ``__main__`` module being recognized as built-in instead of module.
  (:issue:`5897`)
* Fix a bug in :ref:`ctypes dependency scanning <Ctypes Dependencies>` which
  caused references to be missed if the preceding code contains more than
  256 names or 256 literals. (:issue:`5830`)
* Fix collection of duplicated ``_struct`` and ``zlib`` extension modules
  with mangled filenames. (:issue:`5851`)
* Fix python library lookup when building with RH SCL python 3.8 or later.
  (:issue:`5749`)
* Prevent :func:`PyInstaller.utils.hooks.copy_metadata` from renaming
  ``[...].dist-info`` metadata folders to ``[...].egg-info`` which breaks usage
  of ``pkg_resources.requires()`` with *extras*. (:issue:`5774`)
* Prevent a bootloader executable without an embedded CArchive from being
  misidentified as having one, which leads to undefined behavior in frozen
  applications with side-loaded CArchive packages. (:issue:`5762`)
* Prevent the use of ``sys`` or ``os`` as variables in the global namespace
  in frozen script from affecting the ``ctypes`` hooks thar are installed
  during bootstrap. (:issue:`5797`)
* Windows: Fix EXE being rebuilt when there are no changes. (:issue:`5921`)


Hooks
~~~~~

* * Add ``PostGraphAPI.analysis`` attribute.
    Hooks can access the ``Analysis`` object
    through the ``hook()`` function.

  * Hooks may access a ``Analysis.hooksconfig`` attribute
    assigned on ``Analysis`` construction.

    A helper function :func:`~PyInstaller.utils.hooks.get_hook_config`
    was defined in ``utils.hooks`` to get the config. (:issue:`5853`)
* Add support for ``PyQt5`` 5.15.4. (:issue:`5631`)
* Do not exclude ``setuptools.py27compat`` and ``setuptools.py33compat``
  as they are required by other ``setuptools`` modules. (:issue:`5979`)
* Switch the library search order in ``ctypes`` hooks: first check whether
  the given name exists as-is, before trying to search for its basename in
  ``sys._MEIPASS`` (instead of the other way around). (:issue:`5907`)


Bootloader
~~~~~~~~~~

* (macOS) Build bootloader as ``universal2`` binary by default (can
  be disabled by passing ``--no-universal2`` to waf). (:issue:`5581`)
* Add Tcl/Tk based Splash screen, which is controlled from
  within Python. The necessary module to create the Splash
  screen in PyInstaller is under :mod:`Splash` available.
  A huge thanks to `@Chrisg2000 <https://github.com/Chrisg2000>`_ for
  programming this feature. (:issue:`4887`)
* Provide a Dockerfile to build Linux bootloaders for different architectures.
  (:issue:`5995`)


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Document the new macOS multi-arch support and code-signing behavior
  in corresponding sub-sections of ``Notes about specific Features``.
  (:issue:`5581`)


Bootloader build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Update ``clang`` in ``linux64`` Vagrant VM to ``clang-11`` from
  ``apt.llvm.org`` so it can build ``universal2`` macOS bootloader.
  (:issue:`5581`)
* Update ``crossosx`` Vagrant VM to build the toolchain from ``Command Line
  Tools for Xcode`` instead of full ``Xcode package``. (:issue:`5581`)


4.3 (2021-04-16)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Provide basic implementation for ``FrozenImporter.get_source()`` that
  allows reading source from ``.py`` files that are collected by hooks as
  data files. (:issue:`5697`)
* Raise the maximum allowed size of ``CArchive`` (and consequently ``onefile``
  executables) from 2 GiB to 4 GiB. (:issue:`3939`)
* The `unbuffered stdio` mode (the ``u`` option) now sets the
  ``Py_UnbufferedStdioFlag``
  flag to enable unbuffered stdio mode in Python library. (:issue:`1441`)
* Windows: Set EXE checksums. Reduces false-positive detection from antiviral
  software. (:issue:`5579`)
* Add new command-line options that map to collect functions from hookutils:
  ``--collect-submodules``, ``--collect-data``, ``--collect-binaries``,
  ``--collect-all``, and ``--copy-metadata``. (:issue:`5391`)
* Add new hook utility :func:`~PyInstaller.utils.hooks.collect_entry_point` for
  collecting plugins defined through setuptools entry points. (:issue:`5734`)


Bugfix
~~~~~~

* (macOS) Fix ``Bad CPU type in executable`` error in helper-spawned python
  processes when running under ``arm64``-only flavor of Python on Apple M1.
  (:issue:`5640`)
* (OSX) Suppress missing library error messages for system libraries as
  those are never collected by PyInstaller and starting with Big Sur,
  they are hidden by the OS. (:issue:`5107`)
* (Windows) Change default cache directory to ``LOCALAPPDATA``
  (from the original ``APPDATA``).
  This is to make sure that cached data
  doesn't get synced with the roaming profile.
  For this and future versions ``AppData\Roaming\pyinstaller``
  might be safely deleted. (:issue:`5537`)
* (Windows) Fix ``onefile`` builds not having manifest embedded when icon is
  disabled via ``--icon NONE``. (:issue:`5625`)
* (Windows) Fix the frozen program crashing immediately with
  ``Failed to execute script pyiboot01_bootstrap`` message when built in
  ``noconsole`` mode and with import logging enabled (either via
  ``--debug imports`` or ``--debug all`` command-line switch). (:issue:`4213`)
* ``CArchiveReader`` now performs full back-to-front file search for
  ``MAGIC``, allowing ``pyi-archive_viewer`` to open binaries with extra
  appended data after embedded package (e.g., digital signature).
  (:issue:`2372`)
* Fix ``MERGE()`` to properly set references to nested resources with their
  full shared-package-relative path instead of just basename. (:issue:`5606`)
* Fix ``onefile`` builds failing to extract files when the full target
  path exceeds 260 characters. (:issue:`5617`)
* Fix a crash in ``pyi-archive_viewer`` when quitting the application or
  moving up a level. (:issue:`5554`)
* Fix extraction of nested files in ``onefile`` builds created in MSYS
  environments. (:issue:`5569`)
* Fix installation issues stemming from unicode characters in
  file paths. (:issue:`5678`)
* Fix the build-time error under python 3.7 and earlier when ``ctypes``
  is manually added to ``hiddenimports``. (:issue:`3825`)
* Fix the return code if the frozen script fails due to unhandled exception.
  The return code 1 is used instead of -1, to keep the behavior consistent
  with that of the python interpreter. (:issue:`5480`)
* Linux: Fix binary dependency scanner to support `changes to ldconfig
  <https://sourceware.org/git/?p=glibc.git;a=commitdiff;h=dfb3f101c5ef23adf60d389058a2b33e23303d04>`_
  introduced in ``glibc`` 2.33. (:issue:`5540`)
* Prevent ``MERGE`` (multipackage) from creating self-references for
  duplicated TOC entries. (:issue:`5652`)
* PyInstaller-frozen onefile programs are now compatible with ``staticx``
  even if the bootloader is built as position-independent executable (PIE).
  (:issue:`5330`)
* Remove dependence on a `private function
  <https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/commit/e1352c71f07aee7eab004b73dd9bda2a260ab31b>`_
  removed in ``matplotlib`` 3.4.0rc1. (:issue:`5568`)
* Strip absolute paths from ``.pyc`` modules collected into
  ``base_library.zip``
  to enable reproducible builds that are invariant to Python install location.
  (:issue:`5563`)
* (OSX) Fix issues with ``pycryptodomex`` on macOS. (:issue:`5583`)
* Allow compiled modules to be collected into ``base_library.zip``.
  (:issue:`5730`)
* Fix a build error triggered by scanning ``ctypes.CDLL('libc.so')`` on certain
  Linux C compiler combinations. (:issue:`5734`)
* Improve performance and reduce stack usage of module scanning.
  (:issue:`5698`)


Hooks
~~~~~

* Add support for Conda Forge's distribution of ``NumPy``. (:issue:`5168`)
* Add support for package content listing via ``pkg_resources``. The
  implementation enables querying/listing resources in a frozen package
  (both PYZ-embedded and on-filesystem, in that order of precedence) via
  ``pkg_resources.resource_exists()``, ``resource_isdir()``, and
  ``resource_listdir()``. (:issue:`5284`)
* Hooks: Import correct typelib for GtkosxApplication. (:issue:`5475`)
* Prevent ``matplotlib`` hook from collecting current working directory when it
  fails to determine the path to matplotlib's data directory. (:issue:`5629`)
* Update ``pandas`` hook for compatibility with version 1.2.0 and later.
  (:issue:`5630`)
* Update hook for ``distutils.sysconfig`` to be compatible with
  pyenv-virtualenv. (:issue:`5218`)
* Update hook for ``sqlalchemy`` to support version 1.4.0 and above.
  (:issue:`5679`)
* Update hook for ``sysconfig`` to be compatible with pyenv-virtualenv.
  (:issue:`5018`)


Bootloader
~~~~~~~~~~

* Implement full back-to-front file search for the embedded archive.
  (:issue:`5511`)
* Perform file extraction from the embedded archive in a streaming manner
  in order to limit memory footprint when archive contains large files.
  (:issue:`5551`)
* Set the ``__file__`` attribute in the ``__main__`` module (entry-point
  script) to the absolute file name inside the ``_MEIPASS``. (:issue:`5649`)
* Enable cross compiling for FreeBSD from Linux. (:issue:`5733`)


Documentation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Doc: Add version spec file option for macOS Bundle. (:issue:`5476`)
* Update the ``Run-time Information`` section to reflect the changes in
  behavior of ``__file__`` inside the ``__main__`` module. (:issue:`5649`)


PyInstaller Core
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Drop support for python 3.5; EOL since September 2020. (:issue:`5439`)
* Collect python extension modules that correspond to built-ins into
  ``lib-dynload`` sub-directory instead of directly into bundle's root
  directory. This prevents them from shadowing shared libraries with the
  same basename that are located in a package and loaded via ``ctypes`` or
  ``cffi``, and also declutters the bundle's root directory. (:issue:`5604`)

Breaking
~~~~~~~~

* No longer collect ``pyconfig.h`` and ``makefile`` for :mod:`sysconfig`. Instead
  of :func:`~sysconfig.get_config_h_filename` and
  :func:`~sysconfig.get_makefile_filename`, you should use
  :func:`~sysconfig.get_config_vars` which no longer depends on those files. (:issue:`5218`)
* The ``__file__`` attribute in the ``__main__`` module (entry-point
  script) is now set to the absolute file name inside the ``_MEIPASS``
  (as if script file existed there) instead of just script filename.
  This better matches the behavior of ``__file__`` in the unfrozen script,
  but might break the existing code that explicitly relies on the old
  frozen behavior. (:issue:`5649`)



4.2 (2021-01-13)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Add hooks utilities to find binary dependencies of Anaconda distributions.
  (:issue:`5213`)
* (OSX) Automatically remove the signature from the collected copy of the
  ``Python`` shared library, using ``codesign --remove-signature``. This
  accommodates both ``onedir`` and ``onefile`` builds with recent python
  versions for macOS, where invalidated signature on PyInstaller-collected
  copy of the ``Python`` library prevents the latter from being loaded.
  (:issue:`5451`)
* (Windows) PyInstaller's console or windowed icon is now added at freeze-time
  and
  no longer built into the bootloader. Also, using ``--icon=NONE`` allows to
  not
  apply any icon, thereby making the OS to show some default icon.
  (:issue:`4700`)
* (Windows) Enable ``longPathAware`` option in built application's manifest in
  order to support long file paths on Windows 10 v.1607 and later.
  (:issue:`5424`)


Bugfix
~~~~~~

* Fix loading of plugin-type modules at run-time of the frozen application:
  If the plugin path is one character longer than sys._MEIPATH
  (e.g. "$PWD/p/plugin_1" and "$PWD/dist/main"),
  the plugin relative-imports a sub-module (of the plugin)
  and the frozen application contains a module of the same name,
  the frozen application module was imported. (:issue:`4141`, :issue:`4299`)
* Ensure that spec for frozen packages has ``submodule_search_locations`` set
  in order to fix compatibility  with ``importlib_resources`` 3.2.0 and later.
  (:issue:`5396`)
* Fix: No rebuild if "noarchive" build-option changes. (:issue:`5404`)
* (OSX) Fix the problem with ``Python`` shared library collected from
  recent python versions not being loaded due to invalidated signature.
  (:issue:`5062`, :issue:`5272`, :issue:`5434`)
* (Windows) PyInstaller's default icon is no longer built into the bootloader,
  but
  added at freeze-time. Thus, when specifying an icon, only that icon is
  contained in the executable and displayed for a shortcut. (:issue:`870`,
  :issue:`2995`)
* (Windows) Fix "toc is bad" error messages
  when passing a ``VSVersionInfo``
  as the ``version`` parameter to ``EXE()``
  in a ``.spec`` file. (:issue:`5445`)
* (Windows) Fix exception when trying to read a manifest from an exe or dll.
  (:issue:`5403`)
* (Windows) Fix the ``--runtime-tmpdir`` option by creating paths if they don't
  exist and expanding environment variables (e.g. ``%LOCALAPPDATA%``).
  (:issue:`3301`, :issue:`4579`, :issue:`4720`)


Hooks
~~~~~

* (GNU/Linux) Collect ``xcbglintegrations`` and ``egldeviceintegrations``
  plugins as part of ``Qt5Gui``. (:issue:`5349`)
* (macOS) Fix: Unable to code sign apps built with GTK (:issue:`5435`)
* (Windows) Add a hook for ``win32ctypes.core``. (:issue:`5250`)
* Add hook for ``scipy.spatial.transform.rotation`` to fix compatibility with
  SciPy 1.6.0. (:issue:`5456`)
* Add hook-gi.repository.GtkosxApplication to fix TypeError with Gtk macOS
  apps. (:issue:`5385`)
* Add hooks utilities to find binary dependencies of Anaconda distributions.
  (:issue:`5213`)
* Fix the ``Qt5`` library availability check in ``PyQt5`` and ``PySide2`` hooks
  to re-enable support for ``Qt5`` older than 5.8. (:issue:`5425`)
* Implement ``exec_statement_rc()`` and ``exec_script_rc()`` as exit-code
  returning counterparts of ``exec_statement()`` and ``exec_script()``.
  Implement ``can_import_module()`` helper for hooks that need to query module
  availability. (:issue:`5301`)
* Limit the impact of a failed sub-package import on the result of
  ``collect_submodules()`` to ensure that modules from all other sub-packages
  are collected. (:issue:`5426`)
* Removed obsolete ``pygame`` hook. (:issue:`5362`)
* Update ``keyring`` hook to collect metadata, which is required for backend
  discovery. (:issue:`5245`)


Bootloader
~~~~~~~~~~

* (GNU/Linux) Reintroduce executable resolution via ``readlink()`` on
  ``/proc/self/exe`` and preserve the process name using ``prctl()`` with
  ``PR_GET_NAME`` and ``PR_SET_NAME``. (:issue:`5232`)
* (Windows) Create temporary directories with user's SID instead of
  ``S-1-3-4``,
  to work around the lack of support for the latter in ``wine``.
  This enables ``onefile`` builds to run under ``wine`` again. (:issue:`5216`)
* (Windows) Fix a bug in path-handling code with paths exceeding ``PATH_MAX``,
  which is caused by use of ``_snprintf`` instead of ``snprintf`` when
  building with MSC. Requires Visual Studio 2015 or later.
  Clean up the MSC codepath to address other compiler warnings.
  (:issue:`5320`)
* (Windows) Fix building of bootloader's test suite under Windows with Visual
  Studio.
  This fixes build errors when ``cmocka`` is present in the build environment.
  (:issue:`5318`)
* (Windows) Fix compiler warnings produced by MinGW 10.2 in order to allow
  building the bootloader without having to suppress the warnings.
  (:issue:`5322`)
* (Windows) Fix ``windowed+debug`` bootloader variant not properly
  displaying the exception message and traceback information when the
  frozen script terminates due to uncaught exception. (:issue:`5446`)


PyInstaller Core
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* (Windows) Avoid using UPX with DLLs that have control flow guard (CFG)
  enabled. (:issue:`5382`)
* Avoid using ``.pyo`` module file suffix (removed since PEP-488) in
  ``noarchive`` mode. (:issue:`5383`)
* Improve support for ``PEP-420`` namespace packages. (:issue:`5354`)
* Strip absolute paths from ``.pyc`` modules collected in the CArchive (PKG).
  This enables build reproducibility without having to match the location of
  the build environment. (:issue:`5380`)


4.1 (2020-11-18)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Add support for Python 3.9. (:issue:`5289`)
* Add support for Python 3.8. (:issue:`4311`)


Bugfix
~~~~~~

* Fix endless recursion if a package's ``__init__`` module is an extension
  module. (:issue:`5157`)
* Remove duplicate logging messages (:issue:`5277`)
* Fix sw_64 architecture support (:issue:`5296`)
* (AIX) Include python-malloc labeled libraries in search for libpython.
  (:issue:`4210`)


Hooks
~~~~~

* Add ``exclude_datas``, ``include_datas``, and ``filter_submodules`` to
  ``collect_all()``. These arguments map to the ``excludes`` and ``includes``
  arguments of ``collect_data_files``, and to the `filter` argument of
  ``collect_submodules``. (:issue:`5113`)
* Add hook for difflib to not pull in doctests, which is only
  required when run as main program.
* Add hook for distutils.util to not pull in lib2to3 unittests, which will be
  rearly used in frozen packages.
* Add hook for heapq to not pull in doctests, which is only
  required when run as main program.
* Add hook for multiprocessing.util to not pull in python test-suite and thus
  e.g. tkinter.
* Add hook for numpy._pytesttester to not pull in pytest.
* Add hook for pickle to not pull in doctests and argpargs, which are only
  required when run as main program.

4.0 (2020-08-08)
----------------

Features
~~~~~~~~

* Provide setuptools entrypoints to enable other packages to provide
  PyInstaller hooks specific to that package, along with tests for these
  hooks.

  Maintainers of Python packages requiring hooks are invited to use this new
  feature and provide up-to-date PyInstaller support along with their package.
  This is quite easy, see our `sample project`__ for more information
  (:issue:`4232`, :issue:`4301`, :issue:`4582`).
  Many thanks to Bryan A. Jones for implementing the important parts.

  __ https://github.com/pyinstaller/hooksample

* A new package `pyinstaller-hooks-contrib`__ provides monthly updated hooks
  now. This package is installed automatically when installing PyInstaller,
  but can be updated independently.
  Many thanks to Legorooj for setting up the new package
  and moving the hooks there.

  __ https://github.com/pyinstaller/pyinstaller-hooks-contrib

* Added the ``excludes`` and ``includes`` arguments to the hook utility
  function ``collect_data_files``.
* Change the hook collection order so that the hook-priority is command line,
  then entry-point, then PyInstaller builtins. (:issue:`4876`)


Bugfix
~~~~~~

* (AIX) Include python-malloc labeled libraries in search for libpython.
  (:issue:`4738`)
* (win32) Fix Security Alerts caused by subtle implementation differences
  between posix anf windows in ``os.path.dirname()``. (:issue:`4707`)
* (win32) Fix struct format strings for versioninfo. (:issue:`4861`)
* (Windows) cv2: bundle the `opencv_videoio_ffmpeg*.dll`, if available.
  (:issue:`4999`)
* (Windows) GLib: bundle the spawn helper executables for `g_spawn*` API.
  (:issue:`5000`)
* (Windows) PySide2.QtNetwork: search for SSL DLLs in `PrefixPath` in addition
  to `BinariesPath`. (:issue:`4998`)
* (Windows) When building with 32-bit python in onefile mode, set the
  ``requestedExecutionLevel`` manifest key every time and embed the manifest.
  (:issue:`4992`)
* * (AIX) Fix uninitialized variable. (:issue:`4728`, :issue:`4734`)
* Allow building on a different drive than the source. (:issue:`4820`)
* Consider Python<version> as possible library binary path. Fixes issue where
  python is not found if Python3 is installed via brew on OSX (:issue:`4895`)
* Ensure shared dependencies from onefile packages can be opened in the
  bootloader.
* Ensuring repeatable builds of base_library.zip. (:issue:`4654`)
* Fix ``FileNotFoundError`` showing up in ``utils/misc.py`` which occurs when a
  namespace was processed as an filename. (:issue:`4034`)
* Fix multipackaging. The `MERGE` class will now have the correct relative
  paths
  between shared dependencies which can correctly be opened by the bootloader.
  (:issue:`1527`, :issue:`4303`)
* Fix regression when trying to avoid hard-coded paths in .spec files.
* Fix SIGTSTP signal handling to allow typing Ctrl-Z from terminal.
  (:issue:`4244`)
* Update the base library to support encrypting Python bytecode (``--key``
  option) again. Many thanks to Matteo Bertini for finally fixing this.
  (:issue:`2365`, :issue:`3093`, :issue:`3133`, :issue:`3160`,
  :issue:`3198`, :issue:`3316`, :issue:`3619`, :issue:`4241`,
  :issue:`4652`)
* When stripping the leading parts of paths in compiled code objects, the
  longest possible import path will now be stripped. (:issue:`4922`)


Incompatible Changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Remove support for Python 2.7. The minimum required version is now Python
  3.5. The last version supporting Python 2.7 was PyInstaller 3.6.
  (:issue:`4623`)
* Many hooks are now part of the new `pyinstaller-hooks-contrib`
  repository. See below for a detailed list.


Hooks
~~~~~

* Add hook for ``scipy.stats._stats`` (needed for scipy since 1.5.0).
  (:issue:`4981`)
* Prevent hook-nltk from adding non-existing directories. (:issue:`3900`)
* Fix ``importlib_resources`` hook for modern versions (after 1.1.0).
  (:issue:`4889`)
* Fix hidden imports in `pkg_resources`__ and `packaging`__  (:issue:`5044`)

  - Add yet more hidden imports to pkg_resources hook.
  - Mirror the pkg_resources hook for packaging which may or may not be
    duplicate of ``pkg_resources._vendor.packaging``.

  terminated"-check to use snprintf(); check success at more places. (This
  started from fixing GCC warnings for strncpy and strncat.)
* Fix: When copying files, too much data was copied in most cases. This
  corrupted the file and inhibited using shared dependencies. (:issue:`4303`)
* In debug and windowed mode, show the traceback in dialogs to help debug
  pyiboot01_bootstrap errors. (:issue:`4213`, :issue:`4592`)

Bootloader build
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* (AIX) The argument -X32 or -X64 is not recognized by the AIX loader - so this
  code needs to be removed. (:issue:`4730`, :issue:`4731`)
* (OSX) Allow end users to override MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET and
  mmacosx-version-min
  via environment variables and set 10.7 as the fallback value for both.
  (:issue:`4677`)
* Do not print info about ``--noconfirm`` when option is already being used.
  (:issue:`4727`)
