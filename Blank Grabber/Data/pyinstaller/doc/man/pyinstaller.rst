SYNOPSIS
==========

``pyinstaller`` <options> SCRIPT...

``pyinstaller`` <options> SPECFILE


DESCRIPTION
============

PyInstaller is a program that freezes (packages) Python programs into
stand-alone executables, under Windows, GNU/Linux, macOS,
FreeBSD, OpenBSD, Solaris and AIX.
Its main advantages over similar tools are that PyInstaller works with
Python 3.7-3.10, it builds smaller executables thanks to transparent
compression, it is fully multi-platform, and use the OS support to load the
dynamic libraries, thus ensuring full compatibility.

You may either pass one or more file-names of Python scripts or a single
`.spec`-file-name. In the first case, ``pyinstaller`` will generate a
`.spec`-file (as ``pyi-makespec`` would do) and immediately process it.

If you pass a `.spec`-file, this will be processed and most options given on
the command-line will have no effect.
Please see the PyInstaller Manual for more information.


OPTIONS
========

.. include:: _pyinstaller-options.tmp

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
=====================

:PYINSTALLER_CONFIG_DIR:
   This changes the directory where PyInstaller caches some files.
   The default location for this is operating system dependent,
   but is typically a subdirectory of the home directory.
