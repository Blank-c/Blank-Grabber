# different toolkits: Carbon via ctypes, tkinter, PyQt5, provided the logger implements the common log file format.

# level of support (in tkinter/Tk case even depending on the Tk version). Therefore, this test function is currently
# used only with Carbon-based logger and does not (yet) implement toolkit-specific quirks.
