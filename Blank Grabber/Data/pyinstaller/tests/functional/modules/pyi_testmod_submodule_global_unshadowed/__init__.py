# PyInstaller explicitly detects both the definition and undefinition of globals in the modules containing those
# globals -- namely, here. PyInstaller does not, however, detect either the definition or undefinition of these globals
# from other modules. In particular, PyInstaller ignores attempts to undefine this global from the functional test
# exercising this module (e.g., using "del pyi_testmod_submodule_global.submodule").
