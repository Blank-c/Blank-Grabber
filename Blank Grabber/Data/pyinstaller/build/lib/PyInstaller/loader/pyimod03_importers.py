class FrozenResourceReader:
    """
    Resource reader for importlib.resources / importlib_resources support.

    Currently supports only on-disk resources (support for resources from the embedded archive is missing).
    However, this should cover the typical use cases (access to data files), as PyInstaller collects data files onto
    filesystem, and only .pyc modules are collected into embedded archive. One exception are resources collected from
    zipped eggs (which end up collected into embedded archive), but those should be rare anyway.

    When listing resources, source .py files will not be listed as they are not collected by default. Similarly,
    sub-directories that contained only .py files are not reconstructed on filesystem, so they will not be listed,
    either. If access to .py files is required for whatever reason, they need to be explicitly collected as data files
    anyway, which will place them on filesystem and make them appear as resources.

    For on-disk resources, we *must* return path compatible with pathlib.Path() in order to avoid copy to a temporary
    file, which might break under some circumstances, e.g., metpy with importlib_resources back-port, due to:
    https://github.com/Unidata/MetPy/blob/a3424de66a44bf3a92b0dcacf4dff82ad7b86712/src/metpy/plots/wx_symbols.py#L24-L25
    (importlib_resources tries to use 'fonts/wx_symbols.ttf' as a temporary filename suffix, which fails as it contains
    a separator).

    Furthermore, some packages expect files() to return either pathlib.Path or zipfile.Path, e.g.,
    https://github.com/tensorflow/datasets/blob/master/tensorflow_datasets/core/utils/resource_utils.py#L81-L97
    This makes implementation of mixed support for on-disk and embedded resources using importlib.abc.Traversable
    protocol rather difficult.

    So in order to maximize compatibility with unfrozen behavior, the below implementation is basically equivalent of
    importlib.readers.FileReader from python 3.10:
      https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/839d7893943782ee803536a47f1d4de160314f85/Lib/importlib/readers.py#L11
